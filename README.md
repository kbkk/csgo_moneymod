# CS:GO MoneyMod
A MoneyMod for Counter Strike Global Offensive. Money can be gained by multiple activities (e.g. surviving the round) and then spent on different abilities.

# Database
The whole thing can work on an SQLite database. However beware, I experienced performance issues with it.  
I recommend using MySQL or MariaDB.

# Compiling
You need to remove the BlockMaker dependency (native) or replace it with your own since I'm not going to publish it (for now at least).  
Then run spcomp.exe
